<p>
	Trans girls and enbies have always played a significant role in the development of the social&#x2010;networking software <u class=name>Mastodon</u>, making up a significant portion of the original userbase, providing some of the earliest critiques on its approaches to things like privacy, accessibility, and moderation, and contributing code and resources to a number of important featuresâ€”<abbr title="Content Warnings">CWs</abbr>, mutes (in a number of respects), onboarding, documentation, and more.
	After <u class=event>the <time datetime="2017-04" title="2017-04">April</time> influx of users</u>, however, the amount of room and patience for such critical voices in upstream development has decreased, and shifting demographics has meant that the active trans presence in <u class=name>Mastodon</u> development today pales in comparison to what it once was.
<p>
	Noticing that a number of prominent trans voices had grown disillusioned with upstream development, <u class=persName><u class=forename>beatrix</u> <u class=surname>bitrot</u></u> [{% assign bea = page.credits | where: "id", "bea" | first %}{% include handle.html social=bea.social %}] created her own fork, {% include link.html href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs" title="Mastodon Glitch Edition" content="<u class=orgName>GlitchSoc</u>" %} as a way to give people somewhere to test and develop features that weren't finding much support elsewhere.
	<q>I started it so trans women would have somewhere other than mainline to work on <span class=reg><u class=name>Mastodon</u></span></q>, <u class=persName><u class=forename>bea</u></u> told <cite class=series><b class=cybremonday>CYBREMONDAY</b></cite>.
	<q>It's not an exclusive space or project.
	I just have my priorities.</q>
	Since the fork's founding, a number of people (including myself) have worked under <u class=persName><u class=forename>bea</u></u>'s direction to implement a number of new things, and <u class=orgName>GlitchSoc</u>'s <u class=name>Mastodon Glitch Edition</u> is now the software of choice for such instances as {% include link.html href="https://awoo.space" content="<u class=settlement>Awoo.space</u>" %}, {% include link.html href="https://monsterpit.net" content="<u class=settlement>Monsterpit</u>" %}, and {% include link.html href="https://donphan.social" content="<u class=settlement>donphan.social</u>" %}.
<p>
	You can learn more about <u class=orgName>GlitchSoc</u> on its documentation website, {% include link.html href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/" content="glitch-soc.github.io/docs" %}.
