#  CONTRIBUTING  #

_CYBREMONDAY_ accepts contributions!!
We're entirely volunteer-run, so submissions will not be directly compensated.
However, if you have a LiberaPay/Patreon/etc, we'll be happy to pass it along to readers.

To contribute, reach out to [`@kibi@glitch.social`](https://glitch.social/@kibi) (the editor) on Mastodon.
Guidelines for contributions and other information follows.

##  Goals and Scope  ##

 +  The goal of _CYBREMONDAY_ is to shed light on critical queer perspectives, experiences, and culture, in networked digital space.

 +  The goal of _CYBREMONDAY_ is *not* to shed light (critical or otherwise) on mainstream, straight, normative perspectives.
    There is a lot to be said about heteronermativity et al.
    This is not the zine for it.
    Pure critiques of what mainstream corporation Y or straight person W is saying or doing will probably not fly.
    Make queer people your focus.

 +  Part of the ambition of _CYBREMONDAY_ is the proliferation of indie (queer) digital press, especially on Mastodon.
    That means we want people other than just us pushing out zines and issues.
    If we decide that your piece isn't right for our zine:
    That's okay—go start your own!
    (Seriously!!
    We'll help!!)

 +  _CYBREMONDAY_ currently only accepts submissions in English, because that's all we're equipped to edit properly.

##  General Submission Info  ##

 +  You may submit single pieces of work for inclusion in a regular (numbered) issue **or** you may design a guest issue.

 +  The design, editing, layout, titles of pieces, and all final judgment for numbered issues belongs with us.
    The desing and editing of guest issues (including HTML/CSS) is up to you.

 +  Each numbered issue has a theme and hex colour.
    The theme and hex colour for the next issue are included at the end of the current one.

 +  Get in touch before starting a submission and keep us posted on your progress.

 +  You retain copyright over any content you submit, but it must be released under a license compatible with `CC BY-SA`.
    The license of the publication as a whole is `CC BY-SA 4.0 International`.

 +  Large content not suitable for GitHub must be hosted elsewhere.
    Content hosted on most proprietary platforms (eg Youtube) will not be accepted.
    The Internet Archive might be a good choice for some kinds of content.

 +  Audio content, including spoken word stuff and videos with sound, will not be accepted for numbered issues.
    (It's okay if guest issues have them, though.)
    Most other content types are allowed, provided they follow the rules below.

 +  All content __must__ be submitted in a final form by noon on the Saturday before publication, Pacific time (UTC-8).

##  Guest Issues  ##

 +  Guest issues must be marked up and styled in an accessible manner.

 +  JavaScript is not allowed in the top-level document of a guest issue, but is allowed inside of frames.

 +  The design of guest issues should be responsive (be readable on both desktop and mobile devices, or anywhere in-between).

 +  We will work with you to help edit and polish your guest issue (including both its content and its layout/design), but (within reason) final decisions lie with you.

 +  It's okay for guest issues to stray a little bit from the overall _CYBREMONDAY_ focus, but try to keep them within the same ballpark (or else publish them elsewhere lol).

##  Poëtry  ##

 +  Poëtry must be representable in HTML.
    Poëtry which depends on complex alignments or formatting may be dismissed from inclusion.
    Poëtry submitted in image/graphic form will be rejected.

 +  Use of tabs or spaces in poëtry is allowed—these can be preserved where relevant.
    Tabs are preferred over spaces for line indentation.
    Spaces used for layout purposes should be of a fixed width (em, en, etc.) and not generic word-spaces (there are dedicated Unicode characters for this).

 +  It is preferred that poëtry be representable using a proportional serif font, although submissions which depend on monospace formatting will be considered.

##  Prose  ##

 +  Prose (longform) content should target around 700 words, although this isn't a strict requirement.

 +  _CYBREMONDAY_ prose pieces are heavily marked up before publication, but you aren't expected to do this all yourself.
    Mark what you think is important, and we'll take care of the rest.

 +  Markdown or HTML formats are preferred for prose content, although you can also submit as RTF if that is easier.
    Please, no `.doc(x)`, `.pages`, `.odt`, `.tex`, `.pdf`, etc.

 +  You should give your pieces a tentative title, but final decisions regarding piece titles lie with us.

 +  It is very important to *submit prose content early* (even if just as a rough draft), because the editing process for prose is much longer than for other submission types.
    The Wednesday before publication is a good target for a first draft.
    If you want to know the theme of an issue a few weeks in advance, get in touch.

 +  You will be expected to work with us on edits and revisions for prose content.

##  Images  ##

 +  Bitmap images should be submitted as PNG or JPEG, with PNG preferred in most applications.
    Vector images may be submitted as SVG.
    PNGs should be indexed in instances where this does not hurt image quality.

 +  An accessible description should be submitted with each image (or else we will make one up for you).

 +  Images must be static (no animations or scripting).
    If you want to submit a GIF, you should submit it as a looped video instead.

 +  Comics must be submitted with a transcript.

 +  (Non-comic) images should not contain large amounts of text.

##  Video  ##

 +  Videos should be submitted as MP4 or WebM.
    It is up to you whether a video should loop or not.
    Videos must not have sound.

 +  Videos should be submitted alongside a description or transcript which describes the events that take place during.

##  New Media  ##

 +  New media (ie, scripted) content must be includable via a simple `<iframe>` (no scripts on the main page).

 +  Frames may be either staticaly-sized (of fixed width and height) or dynamically-sized (of variable width and height).

 +  Statically-sized content must have fixed (pixel) dimensions.
    The width must not exceed 320px.

 +  Dynamically-sized content should be responsive and appear nicely in any width frame.
    Content should anticipate a frame-height of at least 21.6em.

 +  New media which is hosted by us may use SCSS/CoffeeScript/Liquid as it will be rendered via Jekyll.

##  Letters to the Editor  ##

 +  Write us a letter and we'll publish it!!
    (Presuming, of course, that it isn't enormous and nothing awful is said.)
    Letters aren't edited and you're responsible for your own shit.

##  Other  ##

 +  Weird HTML shit that doesn't fit into one of the categories above may still be accepted so long as it (a) doesn't contain scripting, (b) is accessible, and (c) renders well at all sizes and dimensions.

 +  You can create your own playlists of CC-licensed music, so long as there are streamable MP3s somewhere online.
    These can be embedded in a guest issue, or linked to on their own.
