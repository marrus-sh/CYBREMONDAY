#  CYBREMONDAY  #

<cite class="monogr"><b class="cybremonday">CYBREMONDAY</b></cite> is a weekly webzine focusing on critical queer perspectives and experiences in cybrespace.

##  Origin  ##

The spelling <i class="mentioned">cybre</i> originates from <a href="https://cybre.space/"><u class="placeName">cybre.space</u></a>, a retro-themed <u class="name">Mastodon</u> instance.
The idea of a <i class="mentioned">cybre theory</i> was first (to my knowledge) put forward by [<code class="handle">@amphetamine@social.wxcafe.net</code>](https://social.wxcafe.net/@amphetamine), as a way of conceiving of an internet which exceeded the limits of capitalism to the point where it left them behind completely.

Originally, I had planned for <cite class="monogr"><b class="cybremonday">CYBREMONDAY</b></cite> to be less a theoryzine and more an educational resource, connecting people on <u class="placeName">Mastodon</u> with past conversations about cybre issues and providing them with some informative reading as they went through the week.
However, after reviewing what I was familiar with from the existing material, I found it to be sorely out-of-date and with clear gaps to be filled, especially given all that has happened online in the past year (<time>2017</time>) and the lessons learned from projects like <u class="orgName">Mastodon</u>.

[<code class="handle">@KitRedgrave@glitch.social</code>](https://glitch.social/@KitRedgrave) urged me to compile my thoughts on the current state of cybre into something closer resembling a manifesto, and the result is the ezine you see here.

##  Goals  ##

The primary and foremost goal of <cite class="monogr"><b class="cybremonday">CYBREMONDAY</b></cite> is to develop a strong, independent, community-based queer press.
Some might respond to this by pointing to other, existing queer presses, at which point I ask if there can ever be such a thing as <i class="soCalled">too much queer press</i>.

The secondary goal of <cite class="monogr"><b class="cybremonday">CYBREMONDAY</b></cite> is to help create a space and record for the conversations currently happening on Mastodon regarding cybre life and politics.
Social media is not well&#x2010;equipped for creating lasting dialogues around these issues, and it is my hope that having a weekly publication will help give people something to look back on as they formulate their own critiques within these structures.
It is also important, for historical/archival purposes, that these histories be preserved.
