			In <time>1995</time>, during their annual <u class=event>Word&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;Year</u> vote, the <u class=orgName>American Dialect Society</u> announced <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> as one of {% include link.html href="https://www.americandialect.org/woty/all-of-the-words-of-the-year-1990-to-present#1994" title="All of the Words of the Year, 1990 to Present § 1994 Word of the Year | American Dialect Society" content="the 1994 words of the year" %}.

					The <u class=orgName><abbr title="American Dialect Society">ADS</abbr></u> glossed <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> as <q>pertaining to computers and electronic communication</q>.
					The other word for that year—it was a tie—was, perhaps presciently, <i class=mentioned>morph</i>, <q>to change form</q>.
				<td class=righthand>
					As someone who was born in <time>1994</time>, I have witnessed the evolution of this term firsthand, alongside my own personal development.

	</div>
	<p>
		For most of my life, the word <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> has seemed largely an anachronism, evoked for a sense of <strong>90s&#x2010;era nostalgia</strong>, recalling a time when <u class=bloc>the Internet</u> and computers were considered <strong>an exciting new world of untold possibilities</strong> rather than a <strong>ever&#x2010;present, integrated (and often troubling) part</strong> of our day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day lives.
		In stark contrast are the ways the word has persisted in the common vernacular, through phrases such as <i class=mentioned>cyberwarfare</i>, <i class=mentioned>Cyber Monday</i>, and <i class=mentioned>cyberpunk</i>—signalling <strong>militarism</strong>, <strong>capitalism</strong>, and <strong>dystopia</strong>, respectively; instead of the naïve optimism of the 90s, the <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> of the present&#x2010;day connotates <em>all of the fraughtness and danger that our interconnected technological networks have the potential to contain</em>.
	<p>
		When <u class=persName><u class=forename>Donald</u> <u class=surname>Trump</u></u> made his {% include link.html href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/" title="The first Trump-Clinton presidential debate transcript, annotated | The Washington Post" content="viral remarks" %} about <q>the cyber</q> in the first presidential debate, and as concerns about <u class=country>Russian</u> hacking and botnets took hold, some prescient commentators on <u class=country>Twitter</u> remarked that <time>2017</time> might well end up being <q>the year of the cyber</q>.
		And indeed, over the course of the past year we certainly <em>have</em> seen an increase in discussion and rhetoric pertaining to:
	<ul>
		<li> <strong>{% include link.html href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/02/fake-news-botnets-how-russia-weaponised-the-web-cyber-attack-estonia" title="Fake news and botnets: how Russia weaponised the web | The Guardian" content="<i class=soCalled>Cyberwarfare</i>" %}</strong>
		<li> Social media (especially: <u class=country>Facebook</u>, <u class=country>Twitter</u>)'s <strong>{% include link.html href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/17/technology/facebook-election-influence/index.html" title="Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections | CNNMoney" content="influence" %} on public opinion</strong>

		<li> The <strong>{% include link.html href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/technology/trump-repeal-online-privacy-protections.html" title="Trump Completes Repeal of Online Privacy Protections From Obama Era | The New York Times" content="violation" %} of digital privacy</strong>, both by state governments, and by corporations

	</ul>
	<p>
		Certainly, these topics carry with them <strong>a threat of risk and danger to the people of the world</strong>.
		However, when analysing the <em>reactions</em> that these situations have invoked (<i class=soCalled>fighting <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> with <i class=soCalled>cyber</i></i>; the continuïng lack of accountability of large corporations for the content they distribute <em>or</em> their encroachments into their users' lives; the continuïng rise of online hate and harrassment campaigns—with no end in sight), one begins to wonder <strong>whether they are indeed the threat to the social order that they have been made out to be</strong>, or if they are, in fact, <strong><em>symptomatic of</em></strong> and <strong><em>integral to</em></strong> the present shape of power in modern society.

		The words do not line up with the facts.
		<strong>Far from a threat to society, these unsavory aspects of <i class=soCalled>cyberspace</i> seem to be part&#x2010;and&#x2010;parcel with its normal operation and expected functioning.</strong>
		And—at the same time—<strong>other stories are not being told</strong>.
		<b>The</b> indie <strong>artists and musicians struggling (and, often, <em>succeeding</em>) to find audiences</strong> amidst the massive centralization, appropriation, and commodification of virtually every artform.
		<b>The</b> networks of <strong>trans folx providing each other with care and support</strong> sorely lacking in society at&#x2010;large.
		<b>The</b> <strong>communities of friends, activists, and lovers</strong>, working together, in their spare time, for little&#x2010;to&#x2010;no pay, to design and implement systems which will help to liberate them from capitalism's hold.
		<strong>Some of these are not stories so much as sensations.</strong>
		<b>The</b> <strong>warmth of a screen</strong> on a long, darkened road.
		<b>The</b> <strong>buzz of your partner</strong> after an anxious night alone.
	<p>
		<strong>We must consider the consequences of conceiving of the digital landscape as one of pure capitalistic exploitation and military expansion, in which the lives and needs of its inhabitants are supernumerary and inconsequential (except as subscribers, customers, or subjects) to the machinations of power at play.</strong>
		If this is indeed the shape that <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> space takes on today, <strong><em>might we not need a new kind of fraughtness</em></strong>, one which <strong>challenges this social order</strong> and <strong>reässerts the value of life and community</strong> in our day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day interactions online?
		To put the question another way:
		Is <em>this</em> (capitalism, militarism, exploitation, oppression) all that <q>computers and electronic communication</q> can be?
		Or <strong><em>are there other landscapes imaginable?</em></strong>
	<p>
		Pursuïng this question is what <dfn>cybre theory</dfn> is all about.
		It is a <strong>queering of conventional <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> discourse</strong> to shed light on the <strong>personal</strong>, the <strong>intimate</strong>, the <strong>community</strong>, the <strong>many and varied bonds</strong> which tie us together through technology outside of pure capitalistic norms.
		<strong>It is also a call to action</strong> against those systems and structures which seek to oppress, control, and ultimately erase these bonds from existence.

		Over the past few years, the landscape has shifted dramatically in terms of how we talk about the internet.
		In one sense, this is to say: <strong>we talk about it at all.</strong>
		<u class=country>Twitter</u>, <u class=country>Facebook</u>, et al receive mainstream treatment in the daily news as questions arise regarding everything from {% include link.html href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/28/politics/trump-tweets-legal-cases-official-statements/" title="Trump's tweets central to legal cases on dossier, travel ban and more | CNNPolitics" content="their use" %} by government officials to {% include link.html href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/22/facebook-tries-wipe-out-election-meddling-before-2018-midterms/1055710001/" title="Facebook, admitting it can be bad for democracy, tries to end voter meddling before midterms | USA Today" content="their role" %} in the <u class=event><time>2016</time> <u class=country><abbr title="United States">US</abbr></u> <u class=roleName>Presidential</u> election</u>; bugs like {% include link.html href="http://heartbleed.com/" title="The Heartbleed Bug" content="<u class=name>Heartbleed</u>" %} and {% include link.html href="https://spectreattack.com/" title="Meltdown and Spectre" content="<u class=name>Spectre</u>" %} become issues of international concern; {% include link.html href="www.businessinsider.com/russian-hacker-democrats-dnc-intelligence-2017-12" title="Jailed Russian hacker: I hacked Democrats 'under the command' of Russian intelligence agents | Business Insider" content="hackers" %} and {% include link.html href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-botnet-minecraft-scam-brought-down-the-internet/" title="How a Dorm Room Minecraft Scam Brought Down the Internet | WIRED" content="botnets" %} and {% include link.html href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2962388/the-meme-of-the-year/" title="The Meme Of The Year | MTV News" content="<i class=soCalled>those damn emails</i>" %} have now dominated political discussions for over a year.
	<p>
		Created by mass media for an (inter)national audience, these stories typically centre on big businesses, large governments, or—occasionally—one or two problematic individuals who have managed to make something difficult for the aformentioned.
		<strong>Gone are the days</strong> of talking about <em><i class=soCalled>internet communities</i></em> and <em><i class=soCalled>digital uprising</i></em>—acknowledging the <strong>radical transformative potential</strong> of cybre movements like <code class=hashtag>#ArabSpring</code> ceased quickly once <code class=hashtag>#BlackLivesMatter</code> showed that <strong>it could happen in <u class=country>the States</u> too</strong>.
		Instead, internet spaces are construed as <strong>political in the worst way</strong>—a politics of <strong>pure, empty strucutres</strong>, devoid of life and material consequence, <strong>interacting like clockwork</strong> according to the forces of power at play.

	<p>
		While woefully inaccurate, speaking about the internet as though it were devoid of inhabitants <strong>serves the interests</strong> of <strong>those who seek to exploit it</strong>, ethical concerns—and even personal agency—fading into the distance on such a broad scale.
		As an (to varying degrees) open publishing platform, there is nothing which can be done to <em>directly</em> inhibit the <strong>publishing of counternarratives</strong> or the recognition of individual or collective life, voice, and agency online.
		However, <strong>these things can be easily dismissed</strong> so long as they can be classified as <i class=soCalled>offtopic</i> or <i class=soCalled>irrelevant</i>—and in an age where the <i class=soCalled>relevance</i> of knowledge is <strong>largely determined by corporate algorithms</strong> (à la <u class=orgName>Bing</u>, <u class=orgName>Twitter</u>, <u class=orgName>Facebook</u>, <u class=orgName>Google</u>), this is no small matter.
		In an internet which overflows with <em>information</em>, we have <strong>given up the means</strong> of producing our own <em>knowledge</em>—and it is <strong>well past time</strong> to take those back.
	<p>
		Consequently, it is imperative that we not only concentrate our efforts on the <em>publishing</em> of cybre narratives, but that we also <strong>repeatedly and unrelentingly affirm these narratives as important, topical, and meaningful</strong>, at least as much as those being published on a grander scale.
		<strong>As content which runs counter to the normative gaze of <i class=soCalled>relevance</i></strong>, such stories will <em>by definition</em> be <strong>difficult to discover through <em>conventional</em> means</strong>—and, in many ways, this is desirable.
		But it means that <strong>we must develop a practice of actively promoting, sharing in, and involving ourselves, on the community level, with these conversations</strong>, and create <em>other</em> passages through which they might be seen or heard.
	<p>
		The goal here is not to push radical narratives into the mainstream discourse so much as it is to <strong>decentre the mainstream discourse as the be&#x2010;all and end&#x2010;all of what matters to us, our loved ones, and our communities</strong>.
		The (inter)national politick will always be of concern to the people, but this does not imply that the people should be solely concerned with the (inter)national politick.
		Cybre shops local.
		And so it goes.

		<strong>I was only 14</strong> when <u class=orgName>Yahoo</u> {% include link.html href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/" title="Yahoo Quietly Pulls The Plug On Geocities | TechCrunch" content="announced" %} that <strong><u class=country>GeoCities</u> in the <u class=country>United States</u> would be shut down</strong>—as my internet history at the time consisted almost entirely of <u class=country>RuneScape</u> and <u class=settlement>Wikipedia</u>, it's safe to say that the event hardly registered on my radar.
		I didn't even really learn what <u class=country>GeoCities</u> <em>was</em> until much later, through websites like {% include link.html href="http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/" content="<i class=series>One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op</i>" %} and browsing the collection in {% include link.html href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php" content="<cite class=series>the Internet Archive</cite>" %}.

		<b>The</b> <strong>home&#x2010;wrought, old&#x2010;fashioned look and feel</strong> of the pages;
		<b>the</b> <strong>inconsistent</strong> (often within the same page) <strong>rhetoric and terminology</strong>;
		<b>the</b> <strong>frequent fetishization and sexualization</strong> of queer—especially trans—bodies;
		<b>the</b> <strong>stories of struggle and queer oppression</strong>;
		<b>the</b> <strong>vibrant—if somewhat under&#x2010;the&#x2010;surface—community</strong>, using the tools they had available to persist through it all.
		Other things, perhaps betraying my naïveté, <strong>caught me completely by surprise</strong>; for example, the <strong>long, legalistic introductory pages</strong> which demanded that visitors be a legal adult before even <em>beginning</em> to look at information on being trans or gay.

		From a cursory glance at these websites, it seems the fight for cybre queer representation has <strong>already been won</strong>.
	<p>
		Under the surface, though, things are much the same.
		Queer—especially trans—users are <strong>{% include link.html href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/opinion/twitter-transgender-harassment-problem.html" title="Twitter Has a Transgender Problem | The New York Times" content="frequently" %} {% include link.html href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/google-hangouts-faces-criticism-after-outing-trans-woman" title="Android and Google+ confusion outs trans woman | The Guardian" content="mistreated" %} {% include link.html href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/twitters-new-verification-process-is-a-game-rigged-against-its-marginalized-users" title="Twitter’s New Verification Process is a Game Rigged Against Its Marginalized Users | Model View Culture" content="or" %} {% include link.html href="https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03#.3rpxv7zdr" title="My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not to use on the site | Medium" content="banned" %}</strong> from social media; queer content and resources <strong>{% include link.html href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-hate-speech-policies-censor-marginalized-users/" title="Facebook’s Hate Speech Policies Censor Marginalized Users | WIRED" content="continue" %} to be {% include link.html href="https://qz.com/1190263/why-is-instagram-censoring-zoe-leonards-poem-from-1992/" title="Why is Instagram censoring a 1992 poem revered by the LGBTQ community?" content="restricted" %}</strong>, {% include link.html href="https://gizmodo.com/youtubes-restricted-mode-is-hiding-some-lgbt-content-1793382337" title="YouTube's Restricted Mode Is Hiding Some LGBT Content | Gizmodo" content="especially" %} from {% include link.html href="https://mic.com/articles/180601/twitter-was-flagging-tweets-including-the-word-queer-as-potentially-offensive-content" title="Twitter was flagging tweets including the word &quot;queer&quot; as potentially &quot;offensive content&quot; | Mic" content="younger" %} {% include link.html href="https://theestablishment.co/why-are-tumblr-twitter-and-youtube-blocking-lgbtq-content-e54e7acf4b5c" title="Why Are Tumblr, Twitter, And YouTube Blocking LGBTQ+ Content? | The Establishment" content="users" %}.
		<strong>And there are newer problems as well.</strong>
		<b>The</b> ever&#x2010;in&shy;creasing focus on a <strong>white and/or privileged</strong> gay experience; <b>the</b> <strong>emphasis on allies</strong> and <i class=soCalled>showing support</i> over providing material help or change; <b>the</b> <strong>appropriation of queer narratives and trauma</strong> for clickbait income.
	<p>
		In fact, despite appearances, when it comes to <strong>connecting people with resources</strong> or <strong>accurately reflecting the queer experience</strong> online, <strong><em>things might be worse than ever</em></strong>.
		The steady encroachment on personal and nonprofit websites by <u class=orgName>Google</u>, <u class=orgName>Facebook</u>, and <u class=orgName>Amazon</u>—as well as the post&#x2010;web internet of <u class=persName>Alexa</u> and <u class=persName>Siri</u>—have restricted both the <strong>amount of information available</strong> and the <strong>kind of community structures allowed</strong> to only that which those providers see fit to approve or design for.
		As one particularly drastic example: The <u class=orgName>International Foundation for Gender Education</u> website <strong>{% include link.html href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091104053637/http://www.ifge.org/" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education &amp; Transgender Tapestry | Internet Archive Wayback Machine" content="was once" %} one of the best resources on the web</strong> for trans information—<strong>now it is little more than a {% include link.html href="http://www.ifge.org/" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education" content="poorly&#x2010;formatted blog" %}</strong>.
	<blockquote>
		<p>IFGE has offered a Web site containing information for transgender people since 1998.

		Placing gay cybre culture in the hands of companies whose workforces are primarily straight, white, and male <strong>simply doesn't make sense</strong>.
		Consequently, we must <strong>reclaim and reposition cybre pride</strong> as something which is created under our own authorship, within our own communities.
		<strong>It is not enough</strong> to merely denounce corporations' gesutres towards <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender">LGBT</abbr> acceptance as hypocritical—we must <strong>provide a counternarrative</strong> which <strong>demonstrates and reäffirms queer pride and community</strong>—in all its forms and complexity, outside the boundaries of what is normative or deemed acceptable in the public sphere.
	<p>
		This means <strong>doing more than just protest</strong> (although, by all means, continue to protest).
		It means <strong>finding reason to celebrate</strong> and <strong>making queer culture our own</strong>.

		<strong>It is easy</strong>, when considering and discussing the fraught nature of modern cybrespace—perhaps, when faced with a <cite class=monogr>Manifesto</cite>—to think that <strong>the message of cybre <em>is</em> its message</strong>; that the message is self&#x2010;justifying, so to speak, and the purpose of cybre discourse is to promote cybre discourse and <strong>not some higher aspiration or aim</strong>.
		Given this, <strong>virality seems the obvious tack to take</strong>, spreading and sharing content among friends and peers and social networks, arguïng points and jumping into mentions and doing all of the work that propagating a message entails.
	<p>
		<strong>This impression is deceiving, and it is wrong.</strong>
		The message of cybre—the <strong>imagining of a new digital landscape</strong> which respects <strong>life</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>our many and varied relationships of support</strong>, in <strong>all their diverse complexity</strong>—is <strong>not something which can be spread</strong> via discourse or social media post, but through <strong>decades of work</strong> to develop the structures <strong>from which these forms might evolve</strong>.
		Indeed, <strong>insofar as it diverts queer energies</strong> <strong>away from making progress</strong> and <strong>into defending positions</strong>, and <strong>insofar as it centralizes discussion</strong> inside the normative structures <strong>whose dismantling is our ultimate aim</strong>, <strong>discourse is our opponent</strong> in this journey forward.

		<p>We need fewer well-intentioned essays addressed to bros with good intentions about why sexist language might seem good but is bad.

		<strong>Far from a quick path to success</strong>, virality has proven itself over the past few years to be a <strong>source of violence and harrassment</strong> in exchange for <strong>little or no material gain</strong>.
		Almost by definition, in order to reach a viral state, a message must first be <strong>reduced and reformatted</strong> into something which is <strong>palatable to the mainstream</strong>.
		In doing so, the <strong>fundamental urgency and nuänce</strong> of the original is invariably lost.
		<strong>Viral moments are ephemeral</strong>, burning quickly and then vanishing as the next takes centre&#x2010;stage.
		But <strong>the cybre project is persistent, ongoing, continual</strong>, reaching back to the very first days of networked connectivity and forward into futures unknown.

		In some ways, the project of discourse is <strong>doomed from the start</strong>.
		<strong>How to describe</strong> the <strong>feelings of hurt and precariousness</strong> which accompany everyday life for marginalized queers in the modern connected world?
		<strong>How to explain</strong> that <em>these are <strong>not just numbers</strong> for us</em> (<b>40%</b> of trans respondents attempting suicide at some time in their lives, <b>30%</b> experiencing homelessness, <b>47%</b> being victims of sexual assault, <b>10%</b> in the last year, <b>13%</b> while in K–12, <b>58%</b> reporting harrassment by police in the past year alone, <b>30%</b> facing mistreatment in the workplace, <b>15%</b> now facing unemployment, <b>29%</b> living in poverty, and all of these numbers increasing dramatically when componded with other forms of marginalization—according to {% include link.html href="http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports" title="USTS Reports | 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey" content="the <cite class=monogr>2015 U.S. Transgender Survey</cite>" %}), but <strong>our lived experiences</strong>, and those of <strong>our friends</strong>, <strong>our lovers</strong>, <strong>our families</strong>, and <strong>our communities</strong>?
		<strong>How to argue and debate</strong> over the <strong>fundamental value of a life</strong>, its <strong>right to exist</strong> in a space, its <strong>right to the resources and support</strong> that it needs to survive and to flourish, despite whatever forces might seek to oppress and control?
	<p>
		<strong>There are no words, and there never will be.</strong>
		And so <strong>our goal must be something more</strong> than merely <em>seeking understanding</em> or <em>spreading a message</em>.
		It must be to <strong>assert value</strong>, <strong>change the landscape</strong>, <strong>press ever forward</strong> into this cybre realm.
		It must be to <strong>embrace the fraughtness at hand</strong>, <strong>turn it into something meaningful</strong>, <strong>undo the structures which constrain us</strong> and support each other into tomorrow and beyond.
		<strong><em>This is the cybre mission.</em></strong>
		Together onward.
