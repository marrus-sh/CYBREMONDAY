			In <time>1995</time>, during their annual <u class=event>Word&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;Year</u> vote, the <u class=orgName>American Dialect Society</u> announced <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> as one of <a href="https://www.americandialect.org/woty/all-of-the-words-of-the-year-1990-to-present#1994" title="All of the Words of the Year, 1990 to Present § 1994 Word of the Year | American Dialect Society">the 1994 words of the year</a>.
		<table class=split>
			<col><col>

				<td class=lefthand>
					The <u class=orgName><abbr title="American Dialect Society">ADS</abbr></u> glossed <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> as <q>pertaining to computers and electronic communication</q>.
					The other word for that year—it was a tie—was, perhaps presciently, <i class=mentioned>morph</i>, <q>to change form</q>.
				<td class=righthand>
					As someone who was born in <time>1994</time>, I have witnessed the evolution of this term firsthand, alongside my own personal development.
					As such, it seems only fitting that I should be the one to write this now.
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>
		For most of my life, the word <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> has seemed largely an anachronism, evoked for a sense of <strong>90s&#x2010;era nostalgia</strong>, recalling a time when the <u class=placeName>Internet</u> and computers were considered <strong>an exciting new world of untold possibilities</strong> rather than a <strong>ever&#x2010;present, integrated (and often troubling) part</strong> of our day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day lives.
		In stark contrast are the ways the word has persisted in the common vernacular, through phrases such as <i class=mentioned>cyberwarfare</i>, <i class=mentioned>Cyber Monday</i>, and <i class=mentioned>cyberpunk</i>—signalling <strong>militarism</strong>, <strong>capitalism</strong>, and <strong>dystopia</strong>, respectively; instead of the naïve optimism of the 90s, the <i class=mentioned>cyber</i> of the present&#x2010;day connotates <em>all of the fraughtness and danger that our interconnected technological networks have the potential to contain</em>.
	<p>
		When <u class=persName><u class=forename>Donald</u> <u class=surname>Trump</u></u> made his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/" title="The first Trump-Clinton presidential debate transcript, annotated | The Washington Post">viral remarks</a> about <q>the cyber</q> in the first presidential debate, and as concerns about <u class=country>Russian</u> hacking and botnets took hold, some prescient commentators on <u class=placeName>Twitter</u> remarked that <time>2017</time> might well end up being <q>the year of the cyber</q>.
		And indeed, over the course of the past year we certainly <em>have</em> seen an increase in discussion and rhetoric pertaining to:

		<li> Social media (especially: <u class=placeName>Facebook</u>, <u class=placeName>Twitter</u>)'s <strong><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/17/technology/facebook-election-influence/index.html" title="Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections | CNNMoney">influence</a> on public opinion</strong>

	</ul>
	<p>
		Certainly, these topics carry with them <strong>a threat of risk and danger to the people of the world</strong>.
		However, when analysing the <em>reactions</em> that these situations have invoked (<i class=soCalled>fighting <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> with <i class=soCalled>cyber</i></i>; the continuïng lack of accountability of large corporations for the content they distribute <em>or</em> their encroachments into their users' lives; the continuïng rise of online hate and harrassment campaigns—with no end in sight), one begins to wonder <strong>whether they are indeed the threat to the social order that they have been made out to be</strong>, or if they are, in fact, <strong><em>symptomatic of</em></strong> and <strong><em>integral to</em></strong> the present shape of power in modern society.

		The words do not line up with the facts.
		<strong>Far from a threat to society, these unsavory aspects of <i class=soCalled>cyberspace</i> seem to be part&#x2010;and&#x2010;parcel with its normal operation and expected functioning.</strong>
		And—at the same time—<strong>other stories are not being told</strong>.
		<b>The</b> indie <strong>artists and musicians struggling (and, often, <em>succeeding</em>) to find audiences</strong> amidst the massive centralization, appropriation, and commodification of virtually every artform.
		<b>The</b> networks of <strong>trans folx providing each other with care and support</strong> sorely lacking in society at&#x2010;large.
		<b>The</b> <strong>communities of friends, activists, and lovers</strong>, working together, in their spare time, for little&#x2010;to&#x2010;no pay, to design and implement systems which will help to liberate them from capitalism's hold.
		<strong>Some of these are not stories so much as sensations.</strong>
		<b>The</b> <strong>warmth of a screen</strong> on a long, darkened road.
		<b>The</b> <strong>buzz of your partner</strong> after an anxious night alone.
	<p>
		<strong>We must consider the consequences of conceiving of the digital landscape as one of pure capitalistic exploitation and military expansion, in which the lives and needs of its inhabitants are supernumerary and inconsequential (except as subscribers, customers, or subjects) to the machinations of power at play.</strong>
		If this is indeed the shape that <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> space takes on today, <strong><em>might we not need a new kind of fraughtness</em></strong>, one which <strong>challenges this social order</strong> and <strong>reässerts the value of life and community</strong> in our day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day interactions online?
		To put the question another way:
		Is <em>this</em> (capitalism, militarism, exploitation, oppression) all that <q>computers and electronic communication</q> can be?
		Or <strong><em>are there other landscapes imaginable?</em></strong>
	<p>
		Pursuïng this question is what <dfn>cybre theory</dfn> is all about.
		It is a <strong>queering of conventional <i class=soCalled>cyber</i> discourse</strong> to shed light on the <strong>personal</strong>, the <strong>intimate</strong>, the <strong>community</strong>, the <strong>many and varied bonds</strong> which tie us together through technology outside of pure capitalistic norms.
		<strong>It is also a call to action</strong> against those systems and structures which seek to oppress, control, and ultimately erase these bonds from existence.

	<p>
		Over the past few years, the landscape has shifted dramatically in terms of how we talk about the internet.
		In one sense, this is to say: <strong>we talk about it at all.</strong>
		<u class=placeName>Twitter</u>, <u class=placeName>Facebook</u>, et al receive mainstream treatment in the daily news as questions arise regarding everything from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/28/politics/trump-tweets-legal-cases-official-statements/" title="Trump's tweets central to legal cases on dossier, travel ban and more | CNNPolitics">their use</a> by government officials to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/22/facebook-tries-wipe-out-election-meddling-before-2018-midterms/1055710001/" title="Facebook, admitting it can be bad for democracy, tries to end voter meddling before midterms | USA Today">their role</a> in the <u class=event><time>2016</time> <u class=country><abbr title="United States">US</abbr></u> <u class=roleName>Presidential</u> election</u>; bugs like <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" title="The Heartbleed Bug"><u class=name>Heartbleed</u></a> and <a href="https://spectreattack.com/" title="Meltdown and Spectre"><u class=name>Spectre</u></a> become issues of international concern; <a href="www.businessinsider.com/russian-hacker-democrats-dnc-intelligence-2017-12" title="Jailed Russian hacker: I hacked Democrats 'under the command' of Russian intelligence agents | Business Insider">hackers</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-botnet-minecraft-scam-brought-down-the-internet/" title="How a Dorm Room Minecraft Scam Brought Down the Internet | WIRED">botnets</a> and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2962388/the-meme-of-the-year/" title="The Meme Of The Year | MTV News"><i class=soCalled>those damn emails</i></a> have now dominated political discussions for over a year.
	<p>
		Created by mass media for an (inter)national audience, these stories typically centre on big businesses, large governments, or—occasionally—one or two problematic individuals who have managed to make something difficult for the aformentioned.
		<strong>Gone are the days</strong> of talking about <em><i class=soCalled>internet communities</i></em> and <em><i class=soCalled>digital uprising</i></em>—acknowledging the <strong>radical transformative potential</strong> of cybre movements like <code class=hashtag>#ArabSpring</code> ceased quickly once <code class=hashtag>#BlackLivesMatter</code> showed that <strong>it could happen in <u class=country>the States</u> too</strong>.
		Instead, internet spaces are construed as <strong>political in the worst way</strong>—a politics of <strong>pure, empty strucutres</strong>, devoid of life and material consequence, <strong>interacting like clockwork</strong> according to the forces of power at play.

	<p>
		While woefully inaccurate, speaking about the internet as though it were devoid of inhabitants <strong>serves the interests</strong> of <strong>those who seek to exploit it</strong>, ethical concerns—and even personal agency—fading into the distance on such a broad scale.
		As an (to varying degrees) open publishing platform, there is nothing which can be done to <em>directly</em> inhibit the <strong>publishing of counternarratives</strong> or the recognition of individual or collective life, voice, and agency online.
		However, <strong>these things can be easily dismissed</strong> so long as they can be classified as <i class=soCalled>offtopic</i> or <i class=soCalled>irrelevant</i>—and in an age where the <i class=soCalled>relevance</i> of knowledge is <strong>largely determined by corporate algorithms</strong> (à la <u class=orgName>Bing</u>, <u class=orgName>Twitter</u>, <u class=orgName>Facebook</u>, <u class=orgName>Google</u>), this is no small matter.
		In an internet which overflows with <em>information</em>, we have <strong>given up the means</strong> of producing our own <em>knowledge</em>—and it is <strong>well past time</strong> to take those back.
	<p>
		Consequently, it is imperative that we not only concentrate our efforts on the <em>publishing</em> of cybre narratives, but that we also <strong>repeatedly and unrelentingly affirm these narratives as important, topical, and meaningful</strong>, at least as much as those being published on a grander scale.
		<strong>As content which runs counter to the normative gaze of <i class=soCalled>relevance</i></strong>, such stories will <em>by definition</em> be <strong>difficult to discover through <em>conventional</em> means</strong>—and, in many ways, this is desirable.
		But it means that <strong>we must develop a practice of actively promoting, sharing in, and involving ourselves, on the community level, with these conversations</strong>, and create <em>other</em> passages through which they might be seen or heard.
	<p>
		The goal here is not to push radical narratives into the mainstream discourse so much as it is to <strong>decentre the mainstream discourse as the be&#x2010;all and end&#x2010;all of what matters to us, our loved ones, and our communities</strong>.
		The (inter)national politick will always be of concern to the people, but this does not imply that the people should be solely concerned with the (inter)national politick.
		Cybre shops local.
		And so it goes.

		<strong>I was only 14</strong> when <u class=orgName>Yahoo</u> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/" title="Yahoo Quietly Pulls The Plug On Geocities | TechCrunch">announced</a> that <strong><u class=placeName>GeoCities</u> in the <u class=country>United States</u> would be shut down</strong>—as my internet history at the time consisted almost entirely of <u class=placeName>RuneScape</u> and <u class=placeName>Wikipedia</u>, it's safe to say that the event hardly registered on my radar.
		I didn't even really learn what <u class=placeName>GeoCities</u> <em>was</em> until much later, through websites like <a href="http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/"><i class=journal>One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op</i></a> and browsing the collection in <a href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php"><u class=placeName>the Internet Archive</u></a>.
		This discovery came roughly synonymously with my decision to switch to a <u class=orgName>Gender Studies</u> major, and so naturally I found my self <strong>wandering the streets of <u class=district>WestHollywood</u></strong>, browsing the homepages of an <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender">LGBT</abbr> community of years gone by.
	<p>
		Some of what I discovered there, I had <strong>expected to find</strong>:
		<b>The</b> <strong>home&#x2010;wrought, old&#x2010;fashioned look and feel</strong> of the pages;
		<b>the</b> <strong>inconsistent</strong> (often within the same page) <strong>rhetoric and terminology</strong>;
		<b>the</b> <strong>frequent fetishization and sexualization</strong> of queer—especially trans—bodies;
		<b>the</b> <strong>stories of struggle and queer oppression</strong>;
		<b>the</b> <strong>vibrant—if somewhat under&#x2010;the&#x2010;surface—community</strong>, using the tools they had available to persist through it all.
		Other things, perhaps betraying my naïvité, <strong>caught me completely by surprise</strong>; for example, the <strong>long, legalistic introductory pages</strong> which demanded that visitors be a legal adult before even <em>beginning</em> to look at information on being trans or gay.

		<strong>In modern times</strong>, of course, the situation has—at least on the surface—changed.

		Mainstream online press <strong>features <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/queer-voices" title="Queer Voices | HuffPost">explicit</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lgbt" title="Buzzfeed LGBT">queer</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/lgbt" title="LGBT | MSNBC">sections</a></strong>, and <strong>queer media is promoted</strong> to users through services like <u class=orgName>Spotify</u> and <u class=orgName>Netflix</u>.
		From a cursory glance at these websites, it seems the fight for cybre queer representation has <strong>already been won</strong>.
	<p>
		Under the surface, though, things are much the same.
		Queer—especially trans—users are <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/opinion/twitter-transgender-harassment-problem.html" title="Twitter Has a Transgender Problem | The New York Times">frequently</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/google-hangouts-faces-criticism-after-outing-trans-woman" title="Android and Google+ confusion outs trans woman | The Guardian">mistreated</a> <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/twitters-new-verification-process-is-a-game-rigged-against-its-marginalized-users" title="Twitter’s New Verification Process is a Game Rigged Against Its Marginalized Users | Model View Culture">or</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03#.3rpxv7zdr" title="My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not to use on the site | Medium">banned</a></strong> from social media; queer content and resources <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-hate-speech-policies-censor-marginalized-users/" title="Facebook’s Hate Speech Policies Censor Marginalized Users | WIRED">continue</a> to be <a href="https://qz.com/1190263/why-is-instagram-censoring-zoe-leonards-poem-from-1992/">restricted</a></strong>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/youtubes-restricted-mode-is-hiding-some-lgbt-content-1793382337">especially</a> from <a href="https://mic.com/articles/180601/twitter-was-flagging-tweets-including-the-word-queer-as-potentially-offensive-content" title="Twitter was flagging tweets including the word &quot;queer&quot; as potentially &quot;offensive content&quot; | Mic">younger</a> <a href="https://theestablishment.co/why-are-tumblr-twitter-and-youtube-blocking-lgbtq-content-e54e7acf4b5c" title="Why Are Tumblr, Twitter, And YouTube Blocking LGBTQ+ Content? | The Establishment">users</a>.
		<strong>And there are newer problems as well.</strong>
		<b>The</b> ever&#x2010;in&shy;creasing focus on a <strong>white and/or privileged</strong> gay experience; <b>the</b> <strong>emphasis on allies</strong> and <i class=soCalled>showing support</i> over providing material help or change; <b>the</b> <strong>appropriation of queer narratives and trauma</strong> for clickbait income.
	<p>
		In fact, despite appearances, when it comes to <strong>connecting people with resources</strong> or <strong>accurately reflecting the queer experience</strong> online, <strong><em>things might be worse than ever</em></strong>.
		The steady encroachment on personal and nonprofit websites by <u class=orgName>Google</u>, <u class=orgName>Facebook</u>, and <u class=orgName>Amazon</u>—as well as the post&#x2010;web internet of <u class=persName>Alexa</u> and <u class=persName>Siri</u>—have restricted both the <strong>amount of information available</strong> and the <strong>kind of community structures allowed</strong> to only that which those providers see fit to approve or design for.
		As one particularly drastic example: The <u class=orgName>International Foundation for Gender Education</u> website <strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091104053637/http://www.ifge.org/" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education &amp; Transgender Tapestry | Internet Archive Wayback Machine">was once</a> one of the best resources on the web</strong> for trans information—<strong>now it is little more than a <a href="http://www.ifge.org/" title="The International Foundation for Gender Education">poorly&#x2010;formatted blog</a></strong>.
	<blockquote>
		<p>IFGE has offered a Web site containing information for transgender people since 1998. The site was very heavily used by transgender people seeking information on the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with respondents to a 2002 survey identifying the site as the "best source on the internet," (p.&nbsp;102) preferring the site to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> for trans-related information seeking.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Foundation_for_Gender_Education#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

		Placing gay cybre culture in the hands of companies whose workforces are primarily straight, white, and male <strong>simply doesn't make sense</strong>.
		Consequently, we must <strong>reclaim and reposition cybre pride</strong> as something which is created under our own authorship, within our own communities.
		<strong>It is not enough</strong> to merely denounce corporations' gesutres towards <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender">LGBT</abbr> acceptance as hypocritical—we must <strong>provide a counternarrative</strong> which <strong>demonstrates and reäffirms queer pride and community</strong>—in all its forms and complexity, outside the boundaries of what is normative or deemed acceptable in the public sphere.
	<p>
		This means <strong>doing more than just protest</strong> (although, by all means, continue to protest).
		It means <strong>finding reason to celebrate</strong> and <strong>making queer culture our own</strong>.

		<strong>It is easy</strong>, when considering and discussing the fraught nature of modern cybrespace—perhaps, when faced with a <cite class=monogr>Manifesto</cite>—to think that <strong>the message of cybre <em>is</em> its message</strong>; that the message is self&#x2010;justifying, so to speak, and the purpose of cybre discourse is to promote cybre discourse and <strong>not some higher aspiration or aim</strong>.
		Given this, <strong>virality seems the obvious tack to take</strong>, spreading and sharing content among friends and peers and social networks, arguïng points and jumping into mentions and doing all of the work that propagating a message entails.
	<p>
		<strong>This impression is deceiving, and it is wrong.</strong>
		The message of cybre—the <strong>imagining of a new digital landscape</strong> which respects <strong>life</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>our many and varied relationships of support</strong>, in <strong>all their diverse complexity</strong>—is <strong>not something which can be spread</strong> via discourse or social media post, but through <strong>decades of work</strong> to develop the structures <strong>from which these forms might evolve</strong>.
		Indeed, <strong>insofar as it diverts queer energies</strong> <strong>away from making progress</strong> and <strong>into defending positions</strong>, and <strong>insofar as it centralizes discussion</strong> inside the normative structures <strong>whose dismantling is our ultimate aim</strong>, <strong>discourse is our opponent</strong> in this journey forward.
	<blockquote>
		<p>We need fewer well-intentioned essays addressed to bros with good intentions about why sexist language might seem good but is bad. In the tech feminism community, we’ve been writing these essays for most of a decade. The <em>systematic</em> use of abuser tactics to control conversations and shut down criticism continues. These conversations go on and on, and happen over and over, each one seemingly unencumbered by the lessons of the previous one — <em>what’s happening isn’t a conversation at all, but rather, a power struggle</em>.</p>

		<strong>Far from a quick path to success</strong>, virality has proven itself over the past few years to be a <strong>source of violence and harrassment</strong> in exchange for <strong>little or no material gain</strong>.
		Almost by definition, in order to reach a viral state, a message must first be <strong>reduced and reformatted</strong> into something which is <strong>palatable to the mainstream</strong>.
		In doing so, the <strong>fundamental urgency and nuänce</strong> of the original is invariably lost.
		<strong>Viral moments are ephemeral</strong>, burning quickly and then vanishing as the next takes centre&#x2010;stage.
		But <strong>the cybre project is persistent, ongoing, continual</strong>, reaching back to the very first days of networked connectivity and forward into futures unknown.

		In some ways, the project of discourse is <strong>doomed from the start</strong>.
		<strong>How to describe</strong> the <strong>feelings of hurt and precariousness</strong> which accompany everyday life for marginalized queers in the modern connected world?
		<strong>How to explain</strong> that <em>these are <strong>not just numbers</strong> for us</em> (<b>40%</b> of trans respondents attempting suicide at some time in their lives, <b>30%</b> experiencing homelessness, <b>47%</b> being victims of sexual assault, <b>10%</b> in the last year, <b>13%</b> while in K–12, <b>58%</b> reporting harrassment by police in the past year alone, <b>30%</b> facing mistreatment in the workplace, <b>15%</b> now facing unemployment, <b>29%</b> living in poverty, and all of these numbers increasing dramatically when componded with other forms of marginalization—according to <a href="http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports" title="USTS Reports | 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey">the <cite class=monogr>2015 U.S. Transgender Survey</cite></a>), but <strong>our lived experiences</strong>, and those of <strong>our friends</strong>, <strong>our lovers</strong>, <strong>our families</strong>, and <strong>our communities</strong>?
		<strong>How to argue and debate</strong> over the <strong>fundamental value of a life</strong>, its <strong>right to exist</strong> in a space, its <strong>right to the resources and support</strong> that it needs to survive and to flourish, despite whatever forces might seek to oppress and control?
	<p>
		<strong>There are no words, and there never will be.</strong>
		And so <strong>our goal must be something more</strong> than merely <em>seeking understanding</em> or <em>spreading a message</em>.
		It must be to <strong>assert value</strong>, <strong>change the landscape</strong>, <strong>press ever forward</strong> into this cybre realm.
		It must be to <strong>embrace the fraughtness at hand</strong>, <strong>turn it into something meaningful</strong>, <strong>undo the structures which constrain us</strong> and support each other into tomorrow and beyond.
		<strong><em>This is the cybre mission.</em></strong>
		Together onward.

			At the end of last year, <u class=orgName>PANTONE</u> announced <u class=name>PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra Violet</u> as their <i class=soCalled>Color of the Year</i>.
			<u class=orgName>PANTONE</u> has a long history of <a href="https://www.lokidesign.net/journal/2016/2/22/the-propaganda-of-pantone-colour-and-subcultural-sublimation" title="The Propoganda of Pantone: Colour and Subcultural Sublimation | LOK">sublimating subcultural aesthetic</a> as a way of defanging activist design for the mass market.
			As the <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018" title="Pantone Color of the Year 2018 – 18-3838 Ultra Violet | PANTONE">official press release</a> states:
			<q>Musical icons Prince, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix brought shades of Ultra Violet to the forefront of western pop culture as personal expressions of individuality.
			Nuanced and full of emotion, the depth of PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra Violet symbolizes experimentation and non-conformity, spurring individuals to imagine their unique mark on the world, and push boundaries through creative outlets.</q>
		<p>
			Taking a colour associated with (in their own words) non-conformity and (let's face it) queerness and using it to market capitalistic mass-produced product is downright nefarious and as a friend of the colour purple I say let's not let them get away with it.
			{% include layout_A/colour.html colour="#9900FF" %} is a web-safe purple of roughly the same hue of <u class=name>Ultra Violet</u> but with a little added vim and vigour.
			It's the kind of colour that has only ever existed on the personal web, and which, even in an age of viral vaporwave marketing, any respectable capitalist organization would think twice before using in any official publication.
		<p>
			Let's keep it that way lol.
			Go wild.
